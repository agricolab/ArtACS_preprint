Stimulation at the median nerve above the motor threshold.

Stimulation was applied at the elbow, targetting the median nerve using using a Multi Channel Systems STG 4008. 
Electrophysiological data was acquired with BrainProducts DC Amplifiers at a Sampling Rate of 5000 Hz and a resolution of 0.1 µV.
tACS was applied using a neuroConn DC plus stimulator with carbon rubber electrodes at contralateral supraorbital forehead.

Data is stored as matrix. Rows indicate trials. Columns indicate timepoints. Unit is µV.
Epochs of 1 second lengths (-.5:.5s) were cut time-locked to the stimulation signal.

SEP.mat 		contains 100 trials without tACS on a channel exhibiting a SEP (C4)
SEP_10Hz.mat		contains 100 trials with tACS at 10 Hz at a channel (C4) not exhbiting saturation.
SEP_10Hz_saturated.mat	contains 100 trials with tACS at 10 Hz at a channel (F4) exhbiting saturation.
