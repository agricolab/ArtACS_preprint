Fake ERPs were produced using a Multi Channel Systems STG 4008. The timecourse of the arbitrary stimulus is stored in erp.dat
Electrophysiological data was acquired with BrainProducts DC Amplifiers at a Sampling Rate of 5000 Hz and a resolution of 0.1 µV.
tACS was applied using a neuroConn DC plus stimulator.

Stimulation and recording devices were connected together directly using touch-proof connectors and crocodile clips.

Data is stored as matrix. Rows indicate trials. Columns indicate timepoints. Unit is µV.
Epochs of 6 second lengths (-3:3s) were cut time-locked to the fake ERP.

ERP.mat contains 200 trials without tACS.
ERP_10Hz.mat contains 200 trials with tACS at 10 Hz.
